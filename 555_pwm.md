# Using a 555 to control a motor

The nice thing about using a 555 is that it can operate on 9v...meaning you don't need to translate down to 5v or 3.3v or a different processor.  We're still using a transitor in PWM mode as a switch for the motor.

Varying RV2 and R4 will change the duty cycle (along with the value of C2)...and putting D1 in line between pins 6 and 7 will short-circuit c2's discarge to allow for a shorter duty cycle.
